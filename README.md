# 📊 App User Behavior Segmentation Using Unsupervised Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing application user behavior data using **unsupervised machine learning techniques** to identify distinct user segments based on engagement and activity patterns.

Since real-world user data often lacks predefined labels, **K-Means clustering** was applied to group users with similar behavioral characteristics. The resulting clusters provide **business-actionable insights** for user engagement, retention, and product optimization.

The project also includes an **interactive Streamlit dashboard** that allows stakeholders to visually explore user segments and metrics.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Applications generate large volumes of user activity data, but understanding user behavior without labeled outcomes is challenging.

This project aims to:
- Group users based on similar behavior patterns
- Identify high-engagement and at-risk users
- Enable data-driven marketing, retention, and personalization strategies
- Provide actionable insights without using labeled data
